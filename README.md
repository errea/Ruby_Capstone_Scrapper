# Ruby Capstone Project: Web Scraper.

> Ruby Capstone Project of Microverse, which students have to complete a real-world-like project within 72 hours according to [this project specifications](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Build-your-own-scraper-f54eaca54d8a4d758a5f0141468127a8)

I challenged myself to do a 3-in-1 Web Scraper, which allows users to parse all courses from udacity.com and jobs from indeed.com and remote.io into CSV file.

## Built With

## Project Structure

## Video Presentation
Feel free to check out this [link](https://www.loom.com/share/4e3c2779510740759876c791aacf9868) for a 3min video walkthrough :)

## Deployment
1) Git clone this repo and cd the to the `web_scraper` directory.
2) Run `bundle install` in command line to install Nokogiri and HTTParty Gem.
3) Run `bin/main.rb`.
4) Input either 'udacity', 'indeed', or 'remote.io' and follows the respective commands.
5) Tada! 'udacity_courses.csv', 'indeed_jobs.csv', or 'remote_io.csv' would be created at the root directory respectively :)

## Run tests
1) Git clone this repo and cd the to the `web_scraper` directory.
2) Install rspec with `gem install rspec`.
3) Run `rspec` in Command Line.
4) You would see failures because all 3 scraped files haven't been created yet.
5) To solve it, run `ruby bin/main.rb` and input 'udacity', 'indeed', and 'remote.io' for every execution.
6) Run `rspec` in CLI again. The test cases would success upon each file created :)
